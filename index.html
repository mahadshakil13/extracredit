		<h2>Bronze Medal - Among Us</h2>
		<p class = "info">Among Us is a psychological game, where there are 2 main teams, imposters and crewmates. The imposters objective is
		to eliminate all the crewmates before they can finish all their tasks, while the crewmates are supposed to work together to
		sniff out the imposters and vote them out while trying to finish their tasks. It has led to some funny memes and jokes, as well as 
		been the theme of many different events as well.</p>

		<h2>Silver Medal - The Super Mario Series</h2>
		<p class = "info">The Super Mario series is one of the biggest game franschises in the world, having 19 games along with others such as Mario Kart and SuperSmash Bros.
		Personally, I remember bringing my DS on the bus where everyone would connect to each other and race on mario kart, memories like those are why and many others hold the game
		in such high standing. The popularity of the game franchise is what brought Nintendo to the top along with one other game, which will be holding the #1 spot and the gold medal.</p>

	<h1>Honorable Mentions</h1>
	<section class = "hm">
	
		<h2 class = "honor">Pac-Man</h2>
		<p class = "honorinfo">Pac Man is one of the greates and iconic games of all time. It has multiple TV Shows, game remakes, and many movie references as well.
		Though it peaked in the 1990's to 2000's era, it is still one of the biggest and most widely recognized games of all time!</p>

	<section class = "hm">
		<h2 class = "honor">Sonic</h2>
		<p class = "honorinfo">Very Similar story to Pac-Man, was super popular back in the day, the only difference is that Sonic is widely known even by very young kids today,
		listing it higher than PacMan, but if I did this list by Nostalgia, PacMan most certainly comes out on top.</p>
		<img class = "hmimg" src = "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9rgvllFSV9Yin4_CBXT_0mDMcw=/0x0:1920x1200/1200x800/filters:focal(788x161:1094x467)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339719/sonic_30th.0.jpg" alt = "Official Sonic Poster from Sega, Sonic is in foreground with plain blue background that matches his color.">

		<h2>Gold Medal - Pokemon</h2>
		<p class = "info">Pokemon of course gets the title for the most influential game, with over a decade worth of games, shows, and millions of toys and playing cards. The value of pokemon cards are
		extremely high, some costing nearly a million dollars. There have been almost 10 pokemon games that have been released, and along with them are even more shows each with almost a hundred episodes!
		There is absolutely no debate with this choice, as pikachu and the pokeball are the most known figures in all of Anime, and cartoons in general.</p>
